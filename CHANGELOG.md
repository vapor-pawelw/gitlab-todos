## Unreleased

### General

#### Features

- Made unseen to-dos more apparent in the menu bar with a pulsing unread indicator.
- Added an optional reminder sound picker, disabled by default.

#### Bug Fixes

- Prevented concurrent or timed-out `glab` commands from accumulating and exhausting system memory.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-04-24


### General

#### Features

- Initial project scaffold: Tuist-generated SwiftUI `MenuBarExtra` app targeting macOS 14, Swift 6, localized via per-feature string catalogs.
- Menu bar inbox with rich dropdown rendering avatar, author, action description, project path, state badge (Draft / Open / Merged / Closed) and relative time for each to-do; click a row to open in browser, checkbox to mark as done (optimistic with rollback on failure).
- GitLab-branded menu bar icon with the active to-do count always shown (including 0) and a red dot when unseen to-dos exist; the dot clears the moment the dropdown is opened.
- Hybrid notification delivery: up to three new to-dos become individual banners, four or more collapse into one "N new GitLab to-dos" summary.
- Configurable refresh interval (1 minute to 1 hour) with a manual refresh button and a non-destructive error banner that keeps the last known list clickable when glab fails.
- Four-step guided onboarding (install glab, sign in, notifications, launch at login) with re-check, wrong-default-host detection and copy-paste install commands.
- Self-hosted aware: "Open in browser" and all host-dependent UI use `glab config get host`, falling back to parsing the first to-do's URL.
- Background fetch at app launch so the menu bar count and unseen dot are correct before the user opens the dropdown.
- Homebrew cask distribution with tag-triggered GitHub Actions release workflow, CHANGELOG-sourced release notes and optional automatic tap update.
- "What's New" window that surfaces the latest changelog section after an upgrade.
